# Description 
Our underlying container for Deque will be Linked Lists because most of their methods provide similar functionality as Deque methods. 

# Instance Variables 
- _size <br />
- _front <br />
- _end 
  
# Deque Methods Priority List
  1.  addLast() / pollFirst()
  2.  peekFirst() / size() <br />
  These methods come first so we have a regular queue first.

# Plan
  1. Create interface Deque and copy all methods from Priority List into interface
  2. Create class QQKachoo
  3. Write each method from Priority List one by one, left-most method first
  4. Once compilable, use KtS and forge a variety of test cases to use in QQKachoo 
  5. Add comments to clarify and beautify code
  6. Voila!
